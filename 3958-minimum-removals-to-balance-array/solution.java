/*
Approach is to scan from left to right, right after we sort the array

Why sort? because we need to maintain the order of checking on this condition
k * min must be >= max
We can iteratively check this and adjust the left window index accordingly

Maintain the window of kept elements, then our answer would be -> N - maxKept, where N is the length of nums

T(n) = O(N log N)
S(n) = depends on sorting algo
